Noted indicating how far I got.

After finishing all the npm installs I imported a json file from mtgjson.com.
After running into issues with json file taking a while to load I opened it in 
notepad and removed majority of the cards except the first 4 and retyped the 
json file to match the json structure type. After importing into mongodb I 
confirmed that it was recognized by typing the show dbs command. Created model 
folder with GraphData.js and inserted code. Inserted code for require mongoose, 
model and connect to the database. At this point I checked to see if the 
database was reading but it was not decided to continue with visualization. 
Looked up chart types and decided to go with a pie chart indicating color types.
Inserted code into pie-chart.html, views/index.js, and angular-chart.js. It 
still won't run.
